# Backend Practice Project

This is a backend practice project inspired by YouTubeâ€™s structure.  
The goal is to explore and implement **industry-standard best practices** in backend development, including:

- Project structure and organization  
- API design and routing  
- Database modeling and connections  
- Authentication & authorization (planned)  
- Clean code and maintainability  

The project also aims to bring **e-learning concepts** into one place while serving as a practical learning exercise.
